# IoMT 2024 Attack Classification and Explainability Using XGBoost

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify cyberattacks on Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices using the CIC IoMT 2024 dataset. The workflow involves training an XGBoost model for multiclass classification and utilizing SHAP and LIME for model interpretability.

## Project Structure
- **`colab_notebooks/`**: Contains the main Google Colab notebook with the implementation of the classification and explainability pipeline.
- **`data/`**: Includes dataset files and descriptions.
- **`src/`**: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and explainability.
- **`results/`**: Contains saved plots and evaluation metrics.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the required Python packages.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **`LICENSE`**: License information for the project.
